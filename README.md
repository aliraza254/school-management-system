# school-management-system
 
Project description
The School Management System is a web-based tool that schools can use to make their administrative and educational tasks easier. Its goal is to improve communication between teachers and students, keep school costs down, and make school operations run more smoothly. Laravel, a PHP-based framework with powerful tools for making web applications, will be used to build the system.

Here are the project's goals:

1) To make a website easy for teachers, students, and administrators to use so they can get the information they need and do the things that come with their jobs.
2) To make a central database that keeps track of information about students, teachers, classes, grades, and other school-related things.
3) To use computers to do administrative tasks like keeping track of attendance, grades, and schedules.
4) To give administrators full reporting and analytics tools to track student performance, keep track of attendance and behavior, and make reports that fit their needs.

The following modules will be part of the School Administration System:

Student management: This module will have features like registering, admitting, enrolling, keeping track of attendance, reporting grades, and making transcripts.

Teacher management: With this module, teachers can keep track of their courses, schedules, assignments, grading, and communication with students and parents.

Class management: This module lets administrators add classes and manage them.

Managing expenses: This module will let school administrators handle costs.

Fees management: This module allows administrators to add and manage student fees and print out fee slips.

Salary management: With this module, administrators can add and change teacher salaries and make pay stubs for teachers.

The Laravel-based School Management System will give schools a healthy way to manage their academic and administrative tasks more efficiently. The system will have an easy-to-use interface, features, and strict security measures.
